## Lesson overview

!!! overview ""
    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
    This course is composed of 8 sessions, based on the FAIR training handbook and 10 simple rules to make material FAIR publication. All sessions are structured in a way that complement each other aiming to introduce participants with a theoretical & hands-on approach of how to create FAIR material by design.
    
    Activities are thought to increase the technical skills and critical thinking during the development of a new training course. From A to Z participants are going to be challenged to work in a group to build a FAIR lesson on a topic to be presented at the end of the course. The topic will be disclaimed during the sessions, come inspired!
